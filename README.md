An original game for the Agon Light
Coded 100% on The Agon light. It was an ill concieved ideo from the get go that I perservered with.
A side scrolling sprite based "racing" game written in BASIC? What could go wrong.
It feels to me more like a compilation of coding experiments rather than a good game.
Again the usual learning curve has applied here and I hope to make something a bit more playable in the future.
